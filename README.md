# DoctrineDblibSupportBundle

## Description
This bundle enables PDO\_DBLIB support for connecting to MSSQL databases from PHP running on Linux.  The primary functions of this bundle are to allow you to configure and connect to an MSSQL instance using PDO\_DBLIB and to generate annotated Entity classes that map to the catalog/schema/table form of the MSSQL database.
